            <h1><span class="name-color">HeTian's</span> World</h1>
            <h3>He Tian is a very tall, lean but muscular boy.</h3>
            <p>He Tian was initially seen hanging with Jian Yi and some other classmates, but quickly takes an interest
                in
                Mo Guan Shan, whom he begins to spend most of his time, despite Guan Shan's reluctance. They start off
                with
                a kind of love-hate relationship, mostly from Guan Shan's side, as He Tian was never subtle about his
                physical attraction towards Mo Guan Shan and his obvious flirting. At some point He Tian goes as far as
                kissing him at school.</p>
